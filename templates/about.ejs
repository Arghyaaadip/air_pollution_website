            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Welcome to this curated hub for air pollution science communication materials. This website was created as part of my internship in science communication, where I explored innovative ways to share knowledge about air pollution with diverse audiences. It is inspired by the ethos of inclusivity and accessibility, embodying the goals of the "Leave No One Behind" project spearheaded by the Citizen Science Lab.</p>
            <p>The primary purpose of this platform is to connect users—whether they are researchers, educators, policymakers, young learners, or the general public—with carefully selected materials that can inform and inspire action toward better air quality and sustainability. The resources featured here, including reports, posters, games, and cookbooks, are tailored to engage and educate different target audiences in meaningful ways.</p>
            <p>This website not only serves as a showcase of my work in curating these materials but also reflects my passion for science communication and web development. By integrating creativity with functionality, I aim to provide a user-friendly experience where visitors can explore, learn, and contribute to understanding and mitigating the impacts of air pollution.</p>
            <p>I hope you find this platform both informative and inspiring. Please feel free to reach out through the contact page for questions, feedback, or collaboration opportunities.</p>
